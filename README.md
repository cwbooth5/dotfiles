# .vimrc installation
First, get Vundle installed to manage plugins.

`git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim`

Ensure the `.vimrc` from this repo is in your home directory.

Then open vim and do a plugin install with `:PluginInstall`.

Exit vim and that's it.
